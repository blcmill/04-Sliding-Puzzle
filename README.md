# 04-image-puzzle

This is the fourth programming assignment for ILS-Z399: a sliding-puzzle game. The requirements for this assignment are as follows:

* Write a Python program for playing a simple "sliding puzzle" game
* A popular variant of the sliding puzzle game is the [15 Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). That would be a good place to start
* Using pygame, draw a window and graphics inside the window
* Capture mouse or keyboard events (or both) to enable user interaction
* Report a winning condition if the player completes the puzzle
* Extra credit will be awarded if the puzzle is an image rather than colored shapes (but get the shapes working first!)
* You can assume that the user will have pygame installed on their system

To get a perfect score, you will need to think creatively! Think about ways you can make this project more interesting or fun.

The following may be helpful to get you started:

* [PyGame Drawing Basics](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs5nm/topics/pygame/drawing/)
* [pygame.draw.rect()](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.rect)
* [pygame.font](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/font.html)
* [PyGame Tutorial: Fonts and Text](http://www.nerdparadise.com/programming/pygame/part5)
* [PyGame Events](http://www.raspberry-pi-geek.com/Archive/2014/05/Pygame-modules-for-interactive-programs)
* [pygame.event](https://cs.iupui.edu/~aharris/pgl/pygame-1.7.1release/docs/ref/pygame_event.html)
* You can find some [nice colors here](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/) and their [RGB recipes here](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/ingredients.html)
